## - In the program the user sets the value of Bitcoin they wish to track.
### - The code performs the following;
- Using webscraping tool Beautiful soup it recovers a webpage which shows the current price.
- It then will format the entire information to recover just the current price of Bitcoin.
- It will display this price in the terminal in a string format.
- It will then convert the string to a float and examine the number against the set parameters.
- If the value below a certain parameter, the sound of a cat will play to alert the user. 
- It will then count to 10 prior to checking the price again.



## Of note. keep the timer in place at 10 seconds or longer as not to connect too many times to the target sites server. Use this program responsibly.
